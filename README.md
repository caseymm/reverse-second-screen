# Reverse Second Screen

## THE CHALLENGE
How might we create an immersive experience for users without overwhelming them with information and a variety of content types?

**Reverse Second Screen** helps set the mood and context of a story through ambient sound and images presented on a secondary screen, while the user is going through the core story content on their mobile phone. 

Given the amount of content and external triggers that distract from the reading experience, *Reverse Second Screen* allows the user to read deeply while minimizing the cognitive burden that detracts from a mindful experience.

Certain stories lend themselves to a more immersive experience that command attention and focus. We envision this to be an experience better suited for longer form features as it helps to set an enduring mood by creating a sensory experience that stays with the user throughout.
