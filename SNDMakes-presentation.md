Duration: 5 minutes

GOAL: Just enough to get the concept across in an exciting way.
Indented text is spoken, [] are walkthrough visuals

### Concept intro (1 minute)
The challenge: 

	When we tell stories, how might we create immersive experiences for users without overwhelming them with volume of information and a variety of content types? -- how might we unburden users from the cognitive load of high information density and excessive sensory stimuli, while telling a compelling, immersive story that invokes meaningful emotional responses?

	This is a specially challenging problem on longer pieces that demand user focus and attempt to engage users in a deeper level of thinking. Enter Reverse Second Screen.

The problem being solved/what Reveser Second Screen does: 

	Reverse Second Screen takes advantage of a secondary screen to augment the viewing experience on a primary screen by offloading supporting parts of the sensory experience, specifically the content that helps establish mood and context for a story. Let's take a look.

### example walkthrough 1 (2 minutes)
How it works: 
	
	[Show user loading up a new story on phone]
	Here's a long piece about <topic> told primarily thorugh text and photography.

	[show second screen initiating]
	As the user starts reading, their second screen of choice displays photography, abstract shapes or subtly looped video orchestrated with sound to establish a particular mood and overall feeling the story evokes.

	[show user reading on phone and thumbing down page until they reach a trigger point]
	When relevant, this supporting content changes as the user advances. 

	[cut to second screen with changing content]
	The second screen only changes in concert with the users' reading pace, triggered by moments in the story where a different mood needs to be expressed.

	[pull back, show user on phone and secondary screen nearby]

### example walkthrough 2 (1 minute)

	[close in on phone, show user reaching end of story and loading up a new story at the end of the first]
	Some stories, in addition to a particular mood, are enhanced by establishing context through a sense of place and/or time.
	
	[show second screen initiating]
	As the user starts reading, their second screen of choice displays photography, high-level maps, animation or subtly looped video orchestrated with sound to more quickly create that sense of place, engaging the user in deeper reading sooner. 

	[wide: show scrolling on primary and content switch on secondary]
	The second screen never competes for the user's attention: it's not a dual-display story and the second screen is not meant for complimentary data points and artifacts. Rather, it is there for emotional support.
	
4. wrap up (1 minute) <<< might be too much detail, could end before this.

	[show blank slide with project name]
	Our prototype illustrates the Reverse Second Screen idea using the browser on two devices, which could be accomplished in a variety of devices and further implemeted on things like Chromecast, Roku or gaming devices.

	We used Firebase to <summary> and created event markers on the first screen markup to trigger events on the second screen.
